# Daily Coding Practice

Keep this repository as your daily practice hub. Use the sections below as a living guide for consistent, focused progress in Python and general programming skills.

## Goal

Build a short, repeatable daily practice habit that improves problem solving, fluency with Python, and small project delivery.

## Daily Routine (30–90 minutes)

- Warm-up (10–20 min): quick drills — review notes, flashcards, or 2-3 easy problems.
- Core practice (20–50 min): algorithmic problems, katas, or focused language features.
- Project / Application (10–30 min): incremental work on a small project or automation script.
- Review (5–10 min): write a 2–3 line daily log and note one learning or bug to revisit.

Adjust timeboxes to match your available window; consistency matters more than duration.

## Weekly Structure

- Monday: Fundamentals (data structures, complexity, Python idioms)
- Tuesday: Algorithms (search, sort, recursion, dynamic programming)
- Wednesday: Small Project / Automation
- Thursday: Libraries & Tools (pandas, requests, pytest, virtualenv)
- Friday: Code Review & Refactor (improve earlier work)
- Weekend: Challenge (Advent of Code / Project Euler / take-home practice)

## Exercise Types

- Katas / Algorithmic problems (LeetCode, Codewars)
- Mini-projects (CLI tools, scrapers, automation)
- Reading & rewriting (read a short tutorial and implement it)
- Tests & refactoring (write tests, improve design)

## Daily Log Template

Copy this template for each day in a `practice/` folder as `YYYY-MM-DD.md` or inside a notebook.

- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Time spent: 45 min
- Focus areas: e.g., recursion, list comprehensions
- Exercises completed: (list problems or filenames)
- Key takeaways: 1–2 bullets
- Follow-ups: items to revisit

Example entry

- Date: 2025-11-01
- Time spent: 40 min
- Focus areas: Binary tree traversal
- Exercises completed: LeetCode 94 (inorder), small script `tree_traversal.py`
- Key takeaways: Iterative stack approach is often simpler than recursion for large trees
- Follow-ups: Add unit tests, handle edge cases

## Progress Tracking

- Track streaks, total time, and problems solved per week.
- Keep one file per day in `practice/` and a short `progress.md` that lists weekly metrics.

## Tools & Files

- Use virtual environments (venv) for projects.
- Name practice files clearly: `practice/2025-11-01_my-kata.py` or `practice/2025-11-01.md` for notes.
- Keep runnable examples small and documented with a short header comment explaining purpose and usage.

## Tips for Consistency

- Make the practice time a calendar event.
- Keep problems bite-sized; prefer short wins.
- Review mistakes and record the correct approach in your daily log.
- Pair practice with small, enjoyable projects to keep momentum.
